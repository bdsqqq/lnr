Feature: schema-driven CLI generation
Parent Task: 15

## Task Order (dependencies not enforced by tool, track manually)

**Phase 1: Spec + Tests (parallel tracks)**
- 16: extract current CLI surface as spec (no deps, START HERE)
- 17: generate contract tests from CLI spec (depends on 16)
- 18: spike introspection query (no deps, can run parallel with 16)

**Phase 2: Schema Extraction**
- 19: build schema extraction script (depends on 18)

**Phase 3: Generation**
- 20: generate Issue commands from schema (depends on 17, 19)

**Phase 4: Resolvers (parallel, no deps on each other)**
- 21: implement identifier resolver
- 22: implement state resolver
- 23: implement assignee resolver

**Phase 5: Integration**
- 24: wire generated Issue commands + verify parity (depends on 20, 21, 22, 23)
